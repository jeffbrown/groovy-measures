The groovy-measures project aims to bring a measures DSL to
Groovy.  The library provides capability to do things like:

def length = 2.kilometers
def lengthInInches = length.inches

See the tests under src/test/groovy/ for examples of supported
behavior.

TO use groovy-measures you need to add the groovy-measures jar
file to your CLASSPATH and load the com.g2one.groovy.measures.GroovyMeasures
class, like this:

Class.forName 'com.g2one.groovy.measures.GroovyMeasures'

That class must be loaded early in the process as none of the capabilities
provided by the library are available until your application loads the
GroovyMeasures class.

As the project matures, more capability will be added.  If there
is a feature you would like to see, please drop me a note at
jeff@jeffandbetsy.net.

See the wiki at http://github.com/jeffbrown/groovy-measures/wikis for 
more information.
