The groovy-measures project aims to bring a measures DSL to
Groovy.  The library provides capability to do things like:

def length = 2.kilometers
def lengthInInches = length.inches

See the tests under src/test/groovy/ for examples of supported
behavior.

As the project matures, more capability will be added.  If there
is a feature you would like to see, please drop me a note at
jeff@jeffandbetsy.net.
